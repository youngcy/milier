# milier
a search engineering implement with C++

I intend to implement a search engineering, I do not use mature tools because I want to learn the basic
search engineering skills.

I call it as milier, just I like it.

In my thoughts, the search engineering will including follows part:
  1. crawler
  2. data base a.storage b.cache
  3. indexer
  4. word segment algorithm
  5. parser
  6. milier
  
The basic architecture is:

  crawler1  -----|
  crawler1  -----|
    crawler1  -----|
